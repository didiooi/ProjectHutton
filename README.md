# ProjectHutton
Using NLP, NLG and Database to query and scan well database

Collaborators: Dawn Jobe, Sher (Didi) Ooi, Kamal Hami-Eddine, James Lowell, Vic

Project status: Proof of Concept as part of Geophysics Hackathon


# Motivation 
A geoscientist's dream (apart from having a rock library at home, or more field work to do) is to have a cloud AI personal assistant, who will listen to our requests, query a structured database and return responses in speech form and also display regression plots derived from database


# Vision
How do you make money in an open access - open source world? – Everyone has the same tech, everyone has access to top notch data scientists.  Future competitive edge will be about getting insight from your data – gaining insight more efficiently.  We present to you Hutton, a cognitive assistant for geoscientists.  He is a friend of Alexa’s, and he is hooked into your existing data management system and he is here to help you gain smarter insights, faster.
