Project status: Proof-of-Concept as part of Geophysics Hackathon 2017  


# Motivation 
A geoscientist's dream (apart from having a rock library at home, or more field work to do) is to have a cloud AI personal assistant, who will listen to our requests, query a structured database and return responses in speech form and also display regression plots derived from database


# Vision
How do you make money in an open access - open source world? – Everyone has the same tech, everyone has access to top notch data scientists.  Future competitive edge will be about getting insight from your data – gaining insight more efficiently.  We present to you Hutton, a cognitive assistant for geoscientists.  He is a friend of Alexa’s, and he is hooked into your existing data management system and he is here to help you gain smarter insights, faster.


# Project Description
See [Tutorial Slides](https://github.com/didiooi/ProjectHutton/blob/master/TeamHutton_Geophysics2017_Alexa_Training.pdf) for how we got started  
See [Google Slide](https://goo.gl/M2UFST) on our final presentation  
Unfortunately demo of it was not recorded! Questions asked during Demo on Hutton skill set:  
 “Alexa, ask Hutton …
> 1. to open the well database.  
> 2. what part of the world is the [DB name] data set from?  
> 3. how many wells are in the database?  
> 4. to get wells drilled by [operator name]?  
> 5. how many wells have cumulative production over one billion barrels?  
> 6. which well is the most profitable?
